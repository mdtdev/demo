# This is a simple MarkDown File

## Subhead

This is markdown. It is **awesome** because it uses plain text markup to do formatting of text.

_Italic is marked like this._

**Bold like this!**

1. A list with numbers...
2. ...is easy...
3. ...to make.

And there is math $y = \sin(x)$ that is formatted correctly, not like in Microsoft Wurd.

And you can just drop in HTML if you want to do that, and format it with CSS.
